I Made the Spotify UI/UX clone 
This project is a front-end replica of the Spotify user interface, built using only HTML5 and CSS. It aims to mimic the layout, design, and responsiveness of the Spotify platform.


Spotify UI Clone - HTML5 & CSS
This project is a fully responsive clone of the Spotify user interface, developed using only HTML5 and CSS. The design replicates the core structure and aesthetics of Spotify's platform, including:

A responsive navigation bar.
Album art displays.
Media controls with clean layouts.
Visually appealing color schemes and fonts.
No JavaScript or frameworks were used, making this project a demonstration of the power of pure HTML and CSS in creating modern, user-friendly web designs.
