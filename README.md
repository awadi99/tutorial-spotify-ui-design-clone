I Made the Spotify UI/UX clone
Spotify UI Clone - HTML5 & CSS
This project is a fully responsive clone of the Spotify user interface, developed using only HTML5 and CSS. The design replicates the core structure and aesthetics of Spotify's platform, including:

A responsive navigation bar.
Album art displays.
Media controls with clean layouts.
Visually appealing color schemes and fonts.
No JavaScript or frameworks were used, making this project a demonstration of the power of pure HTML and CSS in creating modern, user-friendly web designs.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as you wish!
